                        <h1 style="font-size: 35px;">Our Principles</h1>
                        <p style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.1;">Our Core Value at Yoga Studio is “Honor the Source” and it is through this value that we share our teachings and navigate our professional, personal and philosophical paths. At the heart of Yogacharya Lalit’s teachings and our
                            school’s mission is the belief that yoga is a holistic science and discipline that should be approached through the Eight Limbs of Yoga to foster balance and increase well-being.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.1;">We believe that yoga should inspire, improve, challenge and nurture the individual to develop a healthy and well rounded spiritual and physical practice. Our philosophy and method has been embraced by students from all backgrounds
                            aged 18-80 and it is through our respect of the individual that this is possible. We take great pride in our trainee graduates who have spread this philosophy around the world.</p>
